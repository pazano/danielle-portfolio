With a mix of high-energy friendliness and low ego professionalism, Danielle is known for her ability to craft a story in a single image. Her bad puns and over the top miming skills remind those on set that our work is fun to do, and she likes to maintain a bit of playfulness in her creations. \tDanielle enjoys using interesting light and saturated palettes to convey movement, thoughtfulness, and joy in her work.</p>\n<p>A true old soul, Danielle has a passion for the decrepit old dusty things you may find in your grandpa\u2019s garage. She loves shooting analog film and can often be found shooting a test roll in a random way as a route to inspiring new creative visions. </p>\n<p>Best described as an ambivert, Danielle is like a dog person in the streets and a cat lady in the deep dark pits of her editing office at home (Did you think we\u2019d say \u201csheets\u201d?
